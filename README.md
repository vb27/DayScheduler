# DayScheduler

## Description
This is a work scheduler that is based off the 9-5 schedule. It has a row for each individual row and a text area that you can save with the button on the far right to the local storage. It tracks time to show which time blocks are past, present, and coming up based on color. Grey is past, Red is current, and Green is future. You can write whatever you want and save and bring it up whenever you want for the day as it will be saved.

## Usage
[example1](/exampleimg/example1.png)
[example2](/exampleimg/example2.png)
The large colored areas area all text areas where you can fill them up with anything you want. By clicking the blue save button you will save all the text in that time blocks to your local storage which you can see in the above example2 picture. This is so that when you close your window and come back all the text will still be there. There is a clear history button at the botton of the page to erase all of the text area when you are done for the day.
